# clean-code-Claude-Skill

Videos from [s4.codes](https://www.tiktok.com/@s4.codes) dropped into Gemini to describe them and condensed into one Claude Skill with Opus 4.6.

## how to use

drop SKILL.md into `~/.claude/skills/clean-code/` and invoke with `/clean-code` command

should work in other tools that have Skills support and check `~/.claude/skills/` folder too (like GitHub Copilot).
